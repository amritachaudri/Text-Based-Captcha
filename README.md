Outcome of the Project:
A GUI with Text based captcha will be required to enter the main GUI have a database.

Concrete goals: 
To develop a text based captcha using GUI and Database in python .So that the text based captcha provides security to the main GUI


WORKING OF THE PROJECT

The text based captcha is made visible by using the ‘gif’ in python GUI. Also the concept of Labels, entry and button is used to make the captcha user friendly and it also provides security to the main data.
 
If the Text entered does not match the text in the image, a message is displayed stating “Sorry, Wrong input “.

If the Text entered matches the text in the image, it will open the Registration GUI that will be having the link to the Login GUI. The Registration GUI requires every entry to be filled. If the entry is not filled, it will ask the user to fill the particular entry. The GUI also checks whether the mobile number entered is valid or not.
 
If every entry is valid the user will be created successfully. 

The Login GUI asks for the users email id and password.
 
When the user is logged in successfully the GUI for entering the specialization opens.
 
When you enter specialization as ADMIN, the GUI to insert the data in the database is opened and it also displays the data existing in the database.
 
User can also enter the specialization as student or teacher but they will not be allowed to insert any data in the existing database. The data in the database will be visible to the user.


Conclusion:
The project shows an GUI using text captcha to provide security to the database and other sensitive data, if the user enters the correct text in the image he can enter in the GUI which has Registration, login, database and asks the user to specify his specialization and if specialization is Admin the user can also enter data in the main database.
